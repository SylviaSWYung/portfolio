          With a background in Cell & Molecular Biology from NTNU, I took a bold
          step toward my true passionâ€”technology. Instead of pursuing a master's
          in biology, I switched to Computer Science and never looked back!
          <br />
          <br />
          Through various projects and a leadership role, I've embraced both my
          creativity and problem-solving skills. I thrive in tech that blends
          innovation with aesthetics and enjoy building solutions that are both
          functional and visually appealing. <br />
          <br />
          In just two years, I've learned so much and can't wait to grow even
          more. I'm highly motivated, social, and always eager to tackle new
          challenges!
