        With a background in Cell & Molecular Biology from NTNU, I took a bold
        step toward my true passionâ€”technology. Instead of pursuing a master's
        in biology, I switched to Computer Science and never looked back! <br />
        <br />
        Through various projects and a leadership role, I've embraced both my
        creativity and problem-solving skills. I thrive in tech that blends
        innovation with aesthetics and enjoy building solutions that are both
        functional and visually appealing. <br />
        <br />
        In just two years, I've learned so much and can't wait to grow even
        more. I'm highly motivated, social, and always eager to tackle new
        challenges!
